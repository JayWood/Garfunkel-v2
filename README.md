# Garfunkel v2

This theme was originally developed by Anders Nor√©n and can be downloaded from the official
[WordPress Theme Repository page](https://wordpress.org/themes/garfunkel/).

## Why v2?
Well to be honest, the last time this theme was updated was July 3, 2016 _(as of June 4, 2017)_.
And I really liked the theme, seems logical to update it.

## Changelog
* Separated two classes from main functions file.
* Fixed excerpts to use `&hellip;` instead of `...`
* Added a space for excerpt ellepsis, easier to read.
* Removed unused variables from multiple files.
* Refactored `garfunkel_flexslider()`
* Separate multiple items into template-parts.
